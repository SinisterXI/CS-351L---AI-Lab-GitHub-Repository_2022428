Project Overview
This project includes multiple versions of a number-guessing game, each implementing different algorithms to guess a number that the player is thinking of. The number is between 1 and 100. The game has both non-AI and AI-based implementations.

Versions
1. Non-AI Version
A simple number-guessing game where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100. The player has 10 attempts to guess the number. The game provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
2. AI Version with Binary Search
In this version, the AI uses a binary search algorithm to guess the number. The player provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The AI adjusts its guesses based on the feedback.
3. AI Version with Breadth-First Search (BFS)
This AI implementation uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to guess the number. It sequentially guesses numbers from a queue and adjusts based on the playerâ€™s feedback.
4. AI Version with Depth-First Search (DFS)
This version uses Depth-First Search (DFS) where the AI guesses numbers by popping them from a stack in descending order. Feedback is used to adjust guesses.
5. AI Version with Genetic Algorithm (GA)
The Genetic Algorithm (GA) implementation starts with a random population of guesses and evolves over generations. It selects, combines, and mutates guesses based on how close they are to the correct number.
